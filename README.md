## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a multilingual AI-powered advisory platform (mobile app + chatbot) designed for real-time, personalized crop guidance. It combines soil analysis, weather forecasting, pest detection, and market insights into a simple, accessible interface with voice and regional language support. The system ensures farmers get scientifically validated advice tailored to their farm conditions without requiring high digital literacy.
## Technical Approach
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch (AI models), React Native/Flutter (mobile app), Node.js (backend), cloud services (AWS/GCP), IoT soil sensors.

Methodology:

Collect soil, weather, crop, and market datasets.

Train ML models for yield prediction, pest detection (image recognition), and fertilizer optimization.

Develop a mobile app with multilingual + voice support.

Build APIs that integrate with weather, mandi price, and government advisory systems.

Pilot testing with farmers, followed by iterative improvements

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: High, due to availability of open datasets, IoT devices, and AI frameworks.

Challenges: Low internet access in rural areas, language/localization complexity, and building user trust.

Mitigation Strategies: Offline functionality with SMS/IVR support, partnerships with local Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and gamification/incentives for farmer engagement.


## Impact and Benefits
Economic: Increased crop yield, reduced unnecessary input use, improved income stability.

Social: Empowerment of farmers through knowledge, reduction in dependency on middlemen.

Environmental: Sustainable farming practices, reduction in chemical overuse, improved soil health.

Institutional: Government and NGOs gain better data insights on farming practices and needs.
